# Optimization Techniques – ECE AUTH 2024-2025

This repository contains three academic projects developed as part of the course **"Optimization Techniques"** during the 7th semester of the undergraduate program at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH). All projects are implemented in MATLAB and involve both unconstrained and constrained optimization methods.

## 📁 Contents

### 🔹 1st Assignment – One-Dimensional Convex Optimization
This project focuses on minimizing one-dimensional convex functions over a given interval using several optimization methods:
- Bisection Method
- Golden Section Search
- Fibonacci Method
- Derivative-based Bisection

Includes:
- Implementation of each method
- Analysis of the effect of key parameters (`ε`, `l`) on convergence
- Graphical representation of interval reduction and objective evaluations

---

### 🔹 2nd Assignment – Unconstrained Multivariable Optimization
This project addresses the minimization of multivariable functions without constraints using:
- Steepest Descent
- Newton’s Method
- Levenberg–Marquardt Method

Includes:
- Experiments with multiple starting points
- Various step-size strategies (fixed, exact line search, Armijo)
- Comparative convergence analysis

---

### 🔹 3rd Assignment – Projected Gradient Descent
Focuses on minimizing a two-variable function using:
- Gradient Descent (unconstrained)
- Projected Gradient Descent under box constraints

Includes:
- Performance analysis under different step sizes and projection parameters
- Convergence diagrams and theoretical justification of results

---

## 💡 Note
Each project folder contains a `.pdf` report with the problem statement, implementation details, convergence plots, and evaluation. MATLAB source code is included for all implementations.
